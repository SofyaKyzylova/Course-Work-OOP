# Course-Work-OOP
The program implements a class system: an information class containing information about a city, and a structure class implementing the structure of a binary pyramid.

The array of objects of the City class is implemented based on the templated Pyramid class.
A pyramid sorting tree on an array (pyramid sorting or heap sorting) is a comparison sorting method based on a data structure such as a binary heap. A binary heap is a complete binary tree in which elements are stored in a special order: the value in the parent node is greater (or less) than the values in its two child nodes.
The main operations of processing a pyramid tree are adding and removing elements, forward and reverse traversal, searching for the value of the vertex of the pyramid, searching for the index of an element by a given value.
The input data of the program is an array of objects of the City class with fields having the following data types: the integer type of the variable Population and the real type of the variable Area, taking values greater than 0; the string type of the variable Name, taking as input a string containing at least one character; the Boolean type of the variable Airport, taking the values true or false (1 or 0). The resulting objects are formed into an array of objects of the class.

The program provides a graphical user interface.
